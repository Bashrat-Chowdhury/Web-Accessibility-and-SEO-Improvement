# Bootcamp Challenge 1

## Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor the code to improve the website's accesibility and SEO ranking. Web accesibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like screen readers,video captions, and braille keyboards. Furthermore, a better SEO ranking allows the website to rank higher in search engines like Google, Yahoo, etc.

To improve accessibility, a concise title was used for the webpage. For this project, semantic HTML elements like "nav" and "footer" were utilized to improve the readibility and structure of the code. Alt text were added to the images on the webpage to allow for easiler accessibility and optimized search ranking. Sequantial heading attribute were used throughout the code.
